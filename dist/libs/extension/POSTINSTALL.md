### Additional Setup

1. As of June 2023, [supported roles for Firebase Extensions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/publishers/access#supported-roles) do not include `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` which is needed for custom auth providers.
   - After deploying the extension, grant the `Service Account Token Creator` role to the extension's service account in [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) under `Firebase Extensions firebase-web-authn service account` > Edit > Assign roles.
   - If the service account isn't appearing, click `Grant Access` and enter its address as `ext-firebase-web-authn@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
2. The browser must reach FirebaseWebAuthn from the same domain as your website. Modify your `firebase.json` to include a rewrite on each app where you'd like to use passkeys:

    ```json
    {
      "hosting": [
        {
          "target": "...",
          "rewrites": [
            {
              "source": "/firebase-web-authn-api",
              "function": "ext-firebase-web-authn-api"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
