      Registers and authenticates WebAuthn passkeys, manages public key credentials in Firestore, and cleans up data if the user cancels a process or unlinks a passkey.

params:
  - param: RELYING_PARTY_NAME
    description: >-
      What relying party name would you like to use? This appears in the passkey window in some browsers in place of your domain name.
    label: Relying Party Name
    required: true
    type: string
  - param: RELYING_PARTY_ID
    description: >-
      What (optional) relying party ID would you like to use? Default behavior uses the hostname of origin, i.e. "login.example.com" when the origin is "https://login.example.com:3000." This is for use (1.) in mobile apps without a domain–provide any domain you control in order to avoid phishing from fraudulent web-based logins–or (2.) to increase passkeys' scope when hosting the app on a subdomain–provide the highest level of domain you control.

    description: >-
      What (optional) [authenticator attachment](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#enum-attachment) for primary passkeys would you like to use? "Cross-platform" only allows physical security keys. "Platform" only allows passkey managers. Default behavior is "Any" which allows either.

    description: >-
      What (optional) [authenticator attachment](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#enum-attachment) for secondary passkeys would you like to use? Default behavior is "Cross-platform" which only allows physical security keys to be used for 2FA. This should differ from the previous setting as it is intended to be a fail-safe.

    default: preferred
    description: >-
      What (optional) [user verification requirement](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#enumdef-userverificationrequirement) would you like to use? Default behavior is "Preferred" which requests user verification when possible. "Required" requests user verification and fails if it is not provided, but does not apply with Authenticator Attachment set to "Cross-platform" since user verification isn't possible with physical security keys. If Authenticator Attachment for Secondary Passkeys (2FA) is set to "Cross-platform," "Required" will not apply to secondary passkeys. "Discouraged" requests skipping user verification to speed up the interaction. See [User Presence vs. User Verification](https://developers.yubico.com/WebAuthn/WebAuthn_Developer_Guide/User_Presence_vs_User_Verification.html).
