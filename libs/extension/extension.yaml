      Optional [user verification requirement](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#enumdef-userverificationrequirement). Please note, the `"required"` setting only works with Authenticator Attachment set to `"platform"` since biometric verification isn't possible with security keys. Also, if Authenticator Attachment for Second-Factor Passkeys is set to `"cross-platform"`, this will only apply to first (1FA) factor passkeys. Default behavior is `"preferred"`.
