Use this extension along with the browser package to add support for WebAuthn as a primary or multi-factor auth provider.
### Additional Setup

```json
{
  "hosting": [
    {
      "target": "...",
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "/firebaseWebAuthn",
          "function": "firebaseWebAuthn"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
