Use this extension and the associated [browser library](https://github.com/gavinsawyer/firebase-web-authn/tree/main/libs/browser) to create and sign in users with passkeys, link and unlink existing users to passkeys, and prompt signed-in users with a biometric verification request.

### Additional Setup

The browser must reach FirebaseWebAuthn from the same domain as your website. Modify your `firebase.json` to include a rewrite on each app where you'd like to use passkeys:

```json
{
  "hosting": [
    {
      "target": "...",
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "/firebase-web-authn-api",
          "function": "ext-firebase-web-authn-api"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
