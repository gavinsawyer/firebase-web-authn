## Authenticate with WebAuthn

**Author**: Gavin Sawyer (**[https://gavinsawyer.dev](https://gavinsawyer.dev)**)

**Description**: Adds support for WebAuthn as a primary or multi-factor auth provider.

**Details**: Use this extension and the associated [browser library](https://github.com/gavinsawyer/firebase-web-authn/tree/main/libs/browser) to create and sign in users with passkeys, link and unlink existing users to passkeys, and prompt signed-in users with a biometric verification request.

### Additional setup
For the browser to reach FirebaseWebAuthn, modify your `firebase.json` to include a rewrite on each app where you'd like to use passkeys.
```json
{
  "hosting": [
    {
      "target": "...",
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "/firebaseWebAuthn",
          "function": "firebaseWebAuthn"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
