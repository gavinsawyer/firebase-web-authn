## @firebase-web-authn/browser
A Firebase Extension for authentication with WebAuthn passkeys.

This package contains five tree-shakeable async methods for using FirebaseWebAuthn in components and a strongly-typed error object.

#### Demo: https://firebase-web-authn.dev
### Methods
```ts
createUserWithPasskey: (auth: Auth, functions: Functions, name: string) => Promise<UserCredential>;
    signInWithPasskey: (auth: Auth, functions: Functions)               => Promise<UserCredential>;
      linkWithPasskey: (auth: Auth, functions: Functions, name: string) => Promise<UserCredential>;
        unlinkPasskey: (auth: Auth, functions: Functions)               => Promise<void>;
verifyUserWithPasskey: (auth: Auth, functions: Functions)               => Promise<void>;
```
Designed to be used like the Firebase JavaScript SDK:
```ts
import { createUserWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";
import { createUserWithPasskey }          from "@firebase-web-authn/browser";
```
```ts
class SignUpComponent {

  constructor(
    private readonly auth: Auth,
    private readonly functions: Functions,
  ) {
    // Firebase JavaScript SDK usage
    this
      .createUserWithEmailAndPassword = (email: string, password: string) => createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)
      .then(() => void(0));

    // FirebaseWebAuthn usage
    this
      .createUserWithPasskey = (name: string) => createUserWithPasskey(auth, functions, name)
      .then(() => void(0));

  }

  public readonly createUserWithEmailAndPassword: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  public readonly createUserWithPasskey: (name: string) => Promise<void>;

}
```
Add `.catch((err: FirebaseWebAuthnError): void => console.error(err))` to these for a detailed error object with a `code`, `message`, `method`, and/or `operation`. `method` is present for Firebase errors, and `operation` is present on all errors except Firebase errors from Auth methods:
```ts
import { FirebaseWebAuthnError } from "@firebase-web-authn/browser";
```
```ts
class FirebaseWebAuthnError extends Error {
  code: `firebaseWebAuthn/${FirebaseError["code"] | "missing-auth" | "missing-user-doc" | "no-op" | "not-verified" | "user-doc-missing-challenge-field" | "user-doc-missing-passkey-fields" | "cancelled" | "invalid"}`;
  message: FirebaseError["message"] | "No user is signed in." | "No user document was found in Firestore." | "No operation is needed." | "User not verified." | "User doc is missing challenge field from prior operation." | "User doc is missing passkey fields from prior operation.";
  method?: "httpsCallableFromURL" | "signInAnonymously" | "signInWithCustomToken";
  operation?: "clear challenge" | "clear user doc" | "create authentication challenge" | "create reauthentication challenge" | "create registration challenge" | "verify authentication" | "verify reauthentication" | "verify registration";
}
```
### Caveats
- If you are using biometrics to confirm an action happening server-side, use the `lastPresent` and `lastVerified` methods from [@firebase-web-authn/server](https://github.com/gavinsawyer/firebase-web-authn/tree/main/libs/server).
- The `webAuthnUsers` collection should not have read or write access from users. Your app should use a separate `users`/`profiles` document.
- The `name` parameter is not automatically stored anywhere except in the passkey. Changes made to this value in a passkey manager are not detectable by the app.
  - If FirebaseWebAuthn is configured as an MFA provider, pass the existing identifier.
  - If FirebaseWebAuthn is your only auth provider, you can pass any recognizable value. If you expect users to have multiple usernameless accounts, `name` can be a user-generated account name ("Personal"/"Work"/etc.). With generic `name` values consider passing something like "${FIRST_NAME} | Personal" for users who share a device with others.
- An anonymous user linked with a passkey is the same as a user created with `createUserWithPasskey`, and appears in Firebase as having no identifier and no provider. Users created this way are not deleted after 30 days with auto clean-up.
- When using `createUserWithPasskey`, you will find that no `onAuthStateChanged` callback fires when converting an anonymous account to a providerless account. Your callback should be passed to `onIdTokenChanged` instead.
